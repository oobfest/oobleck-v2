          li Each workshop is 3 hours long.
          li If a workshop sells out you can get on a waiting list. As students drop reservations will become available to people on the waitlist in the order they signed up.
          li Workshops are open to anyone but it is recommended that students have some improv experience.
          li On the day of the class students can register in-person if the workshop has not sold out.
          li A studentâ€™s spot in a workshop is forfeited if they are more than 10 minutes late without notification. Their spot will become available to those on the waitlist.
