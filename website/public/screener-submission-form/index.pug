            h3 About the Role
            p.font-weight-bold Please read before applying.
            p For this year's festival, we're looking to find 15 to 20 individuals from a variety of backgrounds, disciplines &amp; venue affiliations to review act submissions. 
            p We must warn you: 
              span.font-italic this is not an easy job. 
              | It will require many hours of watching submission videos that will run the full gamut of quality and originality. 

            h4 How It Works
            p There will be at least 400+ act submissions with required videos. Plan on your fair share being rating and commenting on around 125-175. 
            p You will be reviewing either all improv/sketch acts or all standup acts. 

            h4 Required Availability
            p You will be able to review submissions as they come in, starting in March. Your scores will be due by May 15th. Most submissions come on April 30th so this means you will have about two weeks to get a bulk of the work done.  If you have any major time committments between April and mid-May (such as planning a wedding, opening a show or a long vacation) we recommend not applying. 

            h4 What You Get
            p You willl have direct influence on what acts will be accepted into this year's festival so your job is very important!
            p Additionally, all screeners will recieve a free all-access badge that gets you free entrance to any and all shows.
