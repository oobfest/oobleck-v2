  p Auditor slots are offered for sold out workshops, allowing people to attend in a strictly audience capacity. You will be able to watch the workshop, but not able to directly participate. If any registrants to the workshop fail to show up or otherwise forfeiting their slot, auditors will have the opportunity to upgrade into those slots.

p Any attendees who are more than fifteen minutes late from the start of class, without having given prior notification, risk having their slot passed on to someone on the waiting list.
p If you have any questions about further details of your workshop, please direct them to me.
