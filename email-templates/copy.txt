STANDUP REJECTION
[performer name],

Unfortunately, we were unable to include you in this year's Out of Bounds line-up. Every year we receive a record number of applicants, of which a large majority we are unable to accept. We encourage you to keep working, performing, failing and succeeding and hope that you consider applying for next year's festival.

Sincerely,
The Out of Bounds Producer Team



NON-STANDUP REJECTION
[Primary contact name],

Unfortunately, we were unable to include [act name] in this year's Out of Bounds line-up. Out of Bounds is a very difficult festival to get into and every year we break our record number of applicants making it even harder. We encourage you to keep working, rehearsing, trying, failing and succeeding and hope that you consider applying to next year's festival.

Sincerely,
The Out of Bounds Producer Team
